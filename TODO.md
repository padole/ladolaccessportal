- [x] Add MAIL_ADMIN configuration to instance/config.py for admin email address.
- [x] Update new_request route in myapp/user_routes.py to send email notification to admin.
- [ ] Test creating a new user request and verify email notifications are sent to both user and admin.
- [ ] Update documentation if needed to reflect new email notification feature.
- [x] Ensure mail configuration is properly set in instance/config.py (MAIL_SERVER, etc.).
